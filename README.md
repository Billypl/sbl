# SBL - Standard Billy Library  

C++ library where I created custom versions of certain structures inspired by the Standard Template Library (STL). 
I wrote it before going to college to be prepared for all the projects my friend told me about, especially Basics of Programming and Algorithms and Data Structures. 

Features:
- ffile - structure for handling files and making operations on them
- pair - simple pair structure
- vector - dynamic, expandable structure to hold any type of data
- string - based on vector, expandable array of characters with ways to perform simple operations on them
